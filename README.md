# s-m-extra-degree-of-freedom
task3- adding extra degree of freedom to the robotic arm to allow more movement 
in this task we were asked to add extra degree of freedom to the robotic arm 
there are many ways to add extra degree of freedom but in my opinion the best one is to add exrat arm that allow the end effector to rotat around its center like the one i did
for more clarify (see my desine)
